# children

You can compose your own structure of `<DateInput />` by supplying `children`.

The only required child component is `<Field />`.

A `className` prop can also be given to each component directly.

The example below shows the correct nesting structure of all components and their specific [CSS (layout)](/docs/styling-css-layout--docs) styles.

> #### Note:
>
> - Specific nesting is required to provide context to child components - for example: `<ViewBody />` must be a descendant of `<View />`.

### Example:

<Story of={ChildrenStories.Example} />

### Implementation:

<Story of={ChildrenStories.Implementation} />
